<h4>Steam Analysis</h4>

<p>
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>
    is a very popular gaming system and seller of PC games.  Utilizing their APIs,
    I wrote a set of Python scripts to pull game information, player counts, and more
    on a scheduled basis into a MongoDB database.  I have a Raspberry Pi 3 that sits
    and runs these scripts as well as hosts the database.  I'm interested in
    analyzing this data to spot trends in game popularity, types of games,
    price changes, and more.

<p>
    I've started some basic descriptive analysis via Jupyter notebooks as well as
    top modeling via the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis">pyLDAvis</a>
    package.
</p>
<p>
    The code is available
    on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/carlsonp/steam-analysis">Github</a>.
    In the future, after I've collected more data I hope to perform additional analysis such
    as price prediction.
